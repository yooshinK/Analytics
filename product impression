A product impression is when a user views a product on your website. 
Product impressions can occur on product pages, in a product carousel, or in a related products unit. 
If you want to track a product impression, you can use the “add impression” method to pass product data to Google Analytics. 
Note that you will need to customize this code to include data for your specific products.
