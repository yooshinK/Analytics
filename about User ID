Google Analytics sets an anonymous identifier thatâ€™s stored in a browser cookie to recognize unique users. 
The User ID feature lets you override this default behavior letting you instead associate your own anonymous identifier from a CRM system or customer database. 

User IDs allow you to connect an ID from your database to your website when your users interact with that content. 
You could pull a User-ID from your database, pass it through web servers to your website, and then the Google Analytics tracking code can include that ID with its data hits.
