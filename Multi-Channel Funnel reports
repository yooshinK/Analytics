To help you move beyond last-click attribution, Google Analytics has a series of reports called Multi-Channel Funnel reports - or MCF. 
These reports can tell you what role prior marketing activities played in the conversion process. 
A channel that contributed to a conversion prior to the final interaction would be credited with an “assisted conversion.”

Using Channel and Multi-Channel Attribution reports, you can measure whether the campaigns for your business have been successful. 
You can use channel analysis to better understand what channels work for your business and which are most responsible for facilitating conversions.
