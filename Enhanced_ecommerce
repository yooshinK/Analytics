The Enhanced Ecommerce feature in Google Analytics helps you collect behavioral data for your ecommerce business. 
This includes how users interact with on-site marketing, product pages, and the checkout process. But it can also measure very specific things like: 

Clicks on a product link
Views of the product detail pages
Impressions and clicks of internal promotions
Adding or removing a product from a shopping cart
Initiating the checkout process for a product
And purchases and refunds

youâ€™ll first need to add JavaScript code to your web pages that will load the Enhanced Ecommerce plugin. 
This plugin contains a number of JavaScript methods that you can use to collect your various ecommerce data.
