When setting up Content Groups, you have three options for how you assign pages to groups:

“Group By Tracking Code” creates a group using your Google Analytics tracking code.
“Group Using Extraction” creates a group using the URL structure of your pages. 
To use this method you will add a regular expression that extracts the name of your group from the URLs of your pages.
And “Group Using Rule Definitions” creates a group based on simple logic rules. 
For example, you can define one or more rules such as “page contains Android” to group any pages that are related to Android.
