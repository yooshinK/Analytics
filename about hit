Anatomy of a "hit"
With each user interaction on your website, the Analytics tracking code sends what’s called a “hit” to Google Analytics. A “hit” is a URL string with parameters of useful information about your users. It looks something like this:



If we break down the URL string, you can see that it’s passing some useful information to Analytics about the user that triggered the hit. For example, we can see things like:

the language the user’s browser is set to
the name of the page they’re viewing
the screen resolution of the user’s device
and the Analytics ID that associates that hit to the correct Analytics account.
