Remarketing is a powerful tool that lets you target ad content to users who have already visited your website. 
When a user visits your site and doesn’t make a purchase, you can use remarketing to show them relevant ads on the Google Display Network, on mobile apps, or on Google Search. 
This can bring them back to your website and encourage them to make a purchase.

If your Audience in Analytics meets the requirements for Search remarketing, it will be eligible for both Search and Display remarketing in your Google Ads account. 
An Audience list for Google Search ads must have at least 1,000 users before it can be used. 
Note that Audiences that include the Google Display Network's demographics dimensions “Age, Gender, Interests” are not eligible for Search remarketing.
