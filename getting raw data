After Google Analytics has finished processing, you can access and analyze your data using the reports. 
Itâ€™s also possible to access your Analytics data using the Google Analytics Core Reporting API. 
This allows you to build your own reporting tools or extract your data directly into third-party reporting tools.

The Google Analytics Core Reporting API gives you access to most of the report data in Google Analytics. With the Core Reporting API you can:

Build custom dashboards to display Google Analytics data.
Save time by automating complex reporting tasks.
Integrate your Google Analytics data with other business applications.
