Dimensions
Search Page - Page on site where the user enters terms for a web search

Search Results Page - Results page that is returned on a search engine query

Results Pageview - The page viewed after a click on a results page


Example
Assuming your website received three sessions from users that navigate as described below...

Session 1: (time between camera term search page and black camera term search page is 30 seconds; and black camera search to site exit is 60 seconds)
Search Term Page (term: camera) >:
Results Page >
view Results Pageview >
view Results Pageview >
Search Term Page (term: black camera) >
Search Results Page >
view Results Pageview >
view Results Pageview >
view Results Pageview >
Site exit
Session 2: (time between computer term search page to site exit is 15 seconds)
Search Page (term: computer) >
Results Page >
Site exit
Session 3:
No Search
...The following metrics can be calculated:

% Sessions used internal search = 2 Users that used site search (Session 1 & Session 2) / 3 Total Users = 66.7%
Sessions with Search = 2 (Session 1 & Session 2)
Total Unique Searches = 3 (camera, black camera, computer)
Results Pageviews / Search = (2 + 3) / 3 = 1.67
Search Exits = 1 (Session 2)
% Search Exits = 1 (Session 2) / 2 (Session 1 & Session 2) = 50%
Refinement = 1 (Session 1 - black camera)
% Refinement = 1 (Session 1 - black camera) / 3 = 33.3%
Time after Search = (30 seconds + 60 seconds + 15 seconds) / (1 + 1) [session 1 & session 2] = 52.5 sec
Search Depth = (2 [camera] + 3 [black camera] + 0 [computer]) / (1 [Session 1] + 1 [Session 2]) = 2.5
