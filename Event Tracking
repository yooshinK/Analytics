Event tracking is a great way to know if users are engaging with your website and performing intended actions. 

To collect Event data from a website, you'll need to add JavaScript to the individual elements on the site you wish to track. 

“Category” lets you organize the events you track into groups. For your website, this might be “Videos” or “Social Shares.”   
“Action” is the action the user took when they initiated the event. If you were tracking when users click a video play-button, you might have a category called “Videos” with an associated action of “Play.”  
“Label” is an optional value used to further describe the element you’re tracking like the name of a video. This can help you make your event reports more readable. 
“Value” is an optional numerical value like the amount of time it takes a video to load or how much a specific event action is worth. You can use Value to assign a specific dollar amount when a specific action occurs.

Total Events are calculated as the total number of interactions with the tracked element, 
while Unique Events are how many users have triggered that event. 
So if a user clicks on the Google Merchandise Store’s navigation for “Bags” five times in a single session, 
the total number of link clicks for that event will be “five,” but the number of Unique Events will be counted as “one.”
