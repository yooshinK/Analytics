Segmentation in Google Analytics is a way to view a subset of data in a report. You can create user segments or session segments. 
User segments can span multiple sessions with a maximum date range of 90 days. 
For example, you can build a user segment that shows data only for a specific age range, date range, gender, or a combination of these.

Session segments are confined to user behavior within a single session. 
For example, you can create session segments for a Goal users completed during the session or the amount of revenue a user generated.

A powerful part of segments is the ability to add multiple segments to a single report for comparison. 
You can compare segments of users who made a purchase with those that didn’t, to better understand what influences people to buy. 
Or you might choose to build segments based on a specific traffic source like paid search and compare that to sessions that originated from email campaigns. 
This helps you see which types of users each source delivers.

Both user and session segments can be built using dimensions, metrics, session dates, and even sequences of user actions.
