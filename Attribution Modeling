Attribution modeling is a set of rules that determine how sales and conversions get attributed to your marketing campaigns. 
The goal of attribution modeling is to help you better understand how different marketing campaigns and different marketing channels all work together to produce conversions. 
This can help you better allocate and invest your marketing time and budget.

For example, a customer could visit the Google Merchandise Store from a Google Ads ad. 
They could return a week later by clicking on a link in a social network. 
That same day, they could return a third time through an email campaign and make a purchase. 
All of those marketing activities worked together to generate the conversion. 

By default, Google Analytics will attribute all of the credit, or ecommerce revenue, to the last marketing activity 
-- in this case, the email campaign. This is called a “last-click” attribution model.
