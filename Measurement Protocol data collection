Measurement Protocol Overview
The Google Analytics Measurement Protocol allows developers to make HTTP requests to send raw user interaction data directly to Google Analytics servers. 
This allows developers to measure how users interact with their business from almost any environment. Developers can then use the Measurement Protocol to:

Measure user activity in new environments.
Tie online to offline behavior.
Send data from both the client and server.

The Measurement Protocol lets you send data to Analytics from any web-connected device. 
The Analytics JavaScript and mobile SDKs automatically build hits to send data to Analytics. 
However, when you want to collect data from a different device, you must manually build the data collection hits. 
The Measurement Protocol defines how to construct the hits and how to send them to Analytics.
