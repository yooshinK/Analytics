If you have two related websites with different URLs or subdomains that you want to track in a single property, you can set up what’s called “cross-domain tracking.” Cross-domain tracking will recognize when a user navigates between related websites in the same session. This is also known as “site linking.” To set up cross-domain tracking, you’ll need to modify the Analytics tracking code on every page of every site you want to track.
