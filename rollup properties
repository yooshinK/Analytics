 Google Analytics 360 
 roll-up properties
 
 Google Analytics 360 Customers have another way to aggregate data across domains. Using a feature called “rollup reporting,” 
 you can aggregate data automatically from multiple properties into a new combined property.

For example, if the Google Merchandise Store wanted to use one property to track their website and another property to track their mobile app, 
they could also create a third property to aggregate data from both the website and the app to analyze that data together. 
This gives Analytics 360 users options to combine the data from different properties.

Note that roll-up properties don’t include data that you import or link from another account -- like Google Ads. 
If you want to include linked data from your source properties into your roll-up properties, you’ll need to re-link the roll-up property with the linked account.

Also, when users are identified by the same Client ID across different source properties, session data for those users is usually merged; otherwise, 
that session data remains separate.
