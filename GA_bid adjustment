Bid adjustments
Finally, let’s look at the “Bid adjustments” report. Bid adjustments are a Google Ads feature used to automatically adjust keyword bids based on a user’s device, location, or time of day. For example, if the Google Store opens a temporary location during the holidays to sell merchandise, they might want to add a bid adjustment to increase ad visibility on mobile devices within three miles of the store during the hours of operation.

The Bid Adjustment report in Analytics lets you analyze Google Ads performance for the bid adjustments you've set for your campaigns. You can use the selector at the top of the table to evaluate campaign performance by the device, location, time of day, and remarketing list bid adjustments.
